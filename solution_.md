Here is the image of the plot I made (simple matplotlib scatterplot, good enough to show whether there is some correlation trend)

Interpretation: 
 We can see the scatter plot shows a trend of general increase (i.e., as the working population increases, beer consumption also increases).
 This suggests a positive correlation. Refering to what our variables measure, we could say that with larger working populations, there may also be more beer (drinking).
 It is also relevant to mention that just because there is some correlation, it does not mean we can infer causality. Other variables may also be relevat, as potential moderator or confounders.
